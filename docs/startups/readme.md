Become an Idea Generator via the S.C.A.M.P.E.R. Method

This method was initially theorized by Alex Faickney Osborn in 1953 (the OG inventor of the term "brainstorming", yup). Subsequently the SCAMPER was taken up and reworked in numerous texts and studies concerning the generation of ideas and the creative approach to business problems (for example I discovered it by reading the excellent text by Michael Michalko, Thinkertoys).

Growth of Vertical SaaS Challenges Market Leaders, Benefits Startups

For the last few years, it's hard to argue that big horizontal SaaS providers have been anything less than dominant. Backed by some of the largest and most well-capitalized businesses in the world, they have the resources to push their way into multiple industries without breaking a sweat. At the same time, however, vertical SaaS providers have seen an explosion in growth and investment activity. All signs point to it becoming the hotter of the two approaches in the coming years.

5 Reasons Why Your Business Needs VR Today

For example, if you own construction business and frequently work on large projects with many phases that require significant time and investment, it can be difficult to give your clients a true sense of what the finished product will look like. This issue can be solved by creating a VR model of the completed building.

Generally, my team and I following these steps:

Before even thinking about solutions, we try to identify domains where problem solving might be needed.
We get out and observe and talk to people in those domains. We try to understand what they do and the pain points they face.
We identify a problem which is: A) Easy to describe; B) Causing significant challenges for people or businesses; D) So serious, people or businesses are willing to pay to have it solved
Once we clearly understand the problem, then we brainstorm many possible solutions to that problem. We then focus on solutions which can be quickly implemented and deployed to clients

Have You Ever Been Told Your Business Idea Sucks?


We called our solution “CabPool.” A very clever twist on the phrase “carpool.” People would use an app to find others going to the same place as them and share a cab, splitting the cost.

The Thought Process Behind Startup Ideas

Initially, it sounds discouraging that a major industry player failed to implement something similar.

But to me, that’s an encouraging sign.

Large companies fail to innovate because they’re great at what they do. But they’re not organized to develop and distribute the latest technology.

10,000+ Personalized Business Ideas Using Heuristics

Anchor bias is a cognitive trait that leads us to put too much emphasis on information we discover first. Our thought processes are anchored to that early information and subsequent information is viewed with this bias in mind.
This is exactly the same concept we are going to build in to our heuristic business idea generator because we want it to be bias (or personalized) toward ourselves.

An MVP seduces with false reassurances of a clear, linear path to an optimised solution. A Riskiest Assumption Test puts the focus on learning. It is a candle in the darkness that allows us to move forward one step at a time. Once you’ve validated the riskiest assumption you can move on to the next largest one. Gradually building confidence in the viability of your idea.
The MVP is dead. Long live the RAT.
