11 Reasons Why Software Testing Has a Better Future Than Development

Challenges are neither new to developers nor testers. However, building logic and testing logic carry different meanings. You have to think a lot to test the logic behind every piece of code that works in the software. IT companies are still waiting for the real talent to dedicate themselves into the job.

Why Your Project's 1st Commit Should Have a Working App & CI/CD Pipeline

Developers like reuse and fewer barriers, the business likes savings, and an enterprise likes productivity and innovation. However, to inject those benefits is still a very manual, time consuming process, making the overall sell of DevOps harder.

Behavior-Driven Development From Scratch [101]

The starting point is always a scenario, defining the needs of the user. Without this, you can not create software that matters. This "specification" must be made with the main stakeholder: the user (or at least one person who represents and understands him).

Test-Driven Development is Fundamentally Wrong

The second problem here is that TDD presumes that developers should write their own tests. This is supremely ridiculous. I’ve seen this many, many times; the project appears solid to me, I can't break it, but someone else can break it in less than a minute. Why?
Because the same blind spots that I had in design will appear in my tests.

Why AI & ML Will Shake Software Testing up in 2019

The problem of ignored bugs is very diverse and bears extremely negative consequences. We all know how traditional testing works at this moment. If you do not devote enough attention to data management, then, as a result, you will receive a whole bunch of ignored bugs. But that’s not all, because as a result, you get an unsatisfied customer and spoil the brand’s reputation.

Three Patterns for an Effective Cloud Native Development Workflow

Obviously services should be designed to be as cohesive and loosely coupled as possible, which means that the can be developed in isolation. However, when this is not practical, or an engineer wants to drive a more production-like test, techniques like service virtualisation and consumer-driven contracts can be useful patterns.
